I've survived this before, and I'll survive now!
Take a deep breath in and out and think about something that makes you happy!
At this moment, I choose to release the past and look forward to the good that awaits me.
I choose to fill my mind with positive and healing thoughts.
There are no mistakes, only lessons to be learned.
I am cool, calm, and collected
Every breath I inhale calms me and every breath I exhale takes away tension
Every cell in my body is relaxed and oozes calmness
I love myself deeply and unconditionally
As the wonderful, soothing energy of the Universe enters my body, I accept myself completely and deeply, without any reservations
I am confident about solving life's problems successfully
I transcend stress of any kind. I live in peace
I am social and I like meeting people
The future is good. I look towards with hope and happiness
With every breath, I release the anxiety within me and I become more calm and calm
All is well in my world and I am safe
Life is wonderful. I trust in God/Universe to live a well fulfilled life
I overcome my fear of anything and live life courageously
I acknowledge that the only constant in life is change and I am prepared for it
I am free of anxiety and continue to do so
